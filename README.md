Automated Report Generation using Python
Automated report generation is a powerful and efficient way to process raw data, perform analysis, and create structured, formatted reports. This project focuses on developing a Python script that reads data from a file, analyzes the contents, and generates a professionally formatted PDF report using the FPDF library. It is highly useful in academic, business, and technical environments where repetitive and accurate reporting is necessary.

The script begins by importing necessary modules such as csv, statistics, and fpdf. A data file in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format is used as input, which contains sample information like names and their corresponding scores. Python reads this file line by line using the csv.DictReader() class and stores the data in a structured format. Each row in the file is converted into a dictionary, making it easy to access specific columns such as “Name” and “Score”.

After reading the data, the script performs basic statistical analysis using the statistics module. It calculates the average score, and also identifies the individuals with the highest and lowest scores. This analysis step transforms raw data into meaningful insights, which are the backbone of the report. These summary statistics provide a quick overview and help users understand performance trends without going into each individual entry.

Once the analysis is done, the script proceeds to the report generation phase. The FPDF library is used to create the PDF file. FPDF stands for Free PDF and is a Python library that enables the creation of PDF documents easily and efficiently. It supports features such as adding pages, setting fonts, and inserting cells and lines for formatting text in the document.

The report begins with a bold and centered title, such as "Automated Score Report," followed by summary information like average score, and names of individuals with the highest and lowest scores. After the summary section, the script includes a detailed breakdown of each entry from the dataset. This helps in understanding how each individual performed, which is useful in educational or organizational settings.

The generated PDF is saved with a default filename (e.g., report.pdf) in the same folder as the script. Users can customize the filename, add their logos, or modify the font and layout to match their branding needs. This makes the system adaptable to various use cases—from student grade reporting to business performance summaries.

Overall, this project demonstrates how Python can be used as a powerful tool for automating routine tasks such as data analysis and reporting. It eliminates the need for manual processing, reduces errors, and saves valuable time. The use of open-source libraries like FPDF makes it accessible to anyone with basic Python knowledge. By learning to automate report generation, students and professionals alike can enhance their productivity and focus on decision-making rather than data formatting.

This project is an ideal mini-project for internships, coursework, or real-world applications, and it also serves as a stepping stone toward advanced data reporting systems integrated with dashboards and interactive charts.
